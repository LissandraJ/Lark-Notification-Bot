# Lark-Notification-Bot
A bot that informs lark users in the chat when there is an event

Contexte : Two of the many scripts I wrote on Google App Script when I was an intern at Asia Innovations Group in 2022. I was at the localization departement composed mostly by translators, so was I. My leader used lokalise as their localization platform and Googlesheet as their database (Bugdet problems). 

In order to simplify the task management, I built the webhook which enters the task information into the sheet and the larkbot which informs the task-related translators evertime a task is published or finished.


Normally I don't (and am not allowed) to publish scripts I wrote during the Internship. My leader finally got a service on google cloud and my scripts are now unused, I'm therefore able to publish them.
