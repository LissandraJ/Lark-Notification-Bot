# Lark-Notification-Bot
A bot that informs lark users in the chat when there is an event

Contexte : Two of the many scripts I wrote on Google App Script when I was an intern at Asia Innovations Group in 2022. I was at the localization departement composed mostly by translators (So was I. I did fr/en/zh translation & proofreading). My leader used lokalise as their localization platform and Googlesheet as their database (Bugdet problems). 

In order to simplify the task management, I built the webhook which enters the task information into the sheet and the larkbot which informs the task-related translators evertime a task is published or finished.

Lokalise : https://lokalise.com/

Lark : Business chat tool like Teams developped by ByteDance, widely used in China.

Normally I don't (and am not allowed to) publish scripts I wrote during the Internship. My leader finally got a service on google cloud and my scripts are now unused, I'm therefore able to publish them.
